Using collections also makes deleting withou errors much easier.\n","tags":["Level-6"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"txt":{"insertions":19,"deletions":0},"java":{"insertions":63,"deletions":49}}}]}]},"authorFileTypeContributionMap":{"WillCWX":{"java":407,"md":0,"fxml":0,"sh":0,"bat":0,"gradle":0,"txt":49}},"authorContributionVariance":{"WillCWX":66934.555},"authorDisplayNameMap":{"WillCWX":"WILL..XUAN"}}
