flow of the code is currently difficult to follow, and\nmight cause problems in the future when the code has to be revisited\nas a lot of time will have to be spent on figuring out what the\nexpected flow of the code is.\n\nLet\u0027s:\n- remove the finally block in Duke and add it to the try block\ninstead, which simplifies the error catching\n- remove magic strings in Parser\n- refactor the code fragment in Parser to validate whether the regex\nis valid for the given input string to a separate method instead\n- use fallthrough comments to simplify error catching in Parser\n- rename confusing variable in TaskList to better represent the\nvariable\u0027s intended purpose\n- remove unused imports in Storage and Ui\n- fix JavaDoc comments in all files\n\nGuard clauses and fallthrough blocks
